# GREPR
## A grep alternative written in Rust


### Goals

My goal is to create an implementation of grep with built in pattern matching for things such
as ip addresses. This is my first project and intended as a learning experience. I want to 
this project to have the complete functionality of grep then add quality of line features
and the performance of Rust.
